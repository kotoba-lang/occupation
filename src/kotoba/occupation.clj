  Precedence (highest to lowest -- this order is the ADR-derived contract,
  not incidental cond ordering, so read it as normative):
    1. `:reason :no-automation-path` OR `:location :remote` -> :one-off-remote-or-cognitive
       (cloud-itonami-isic-8299). Either signal ALONE is enough: this is the
       least-liability, most-flexible target (no employer-of-record), so it
       wins outright over any :duration value, including :permanent or
       :recurring, whenever the task is structurally remote/cognitive or has
       no automation path at all.
    2. `:duration :permanent` -> :permanent-role (cloud-itonami-isic-7810). A
       durable headcount gap wins over a merely-:recurring signal if both are
       somehow present on the same gap.
    3. `:duration :recurring` AND `:location :on-site` -> :on-site-recurring
       (cloud-itonami-isic-7820).
    4. `:duration :one-off` -> :one-off-remote-or-cognitive (cloud-itonami-isic-8299).
    5. Anything else -- unrecognized or missing :reason/:duration/:location,
       or a combination not covered above (e.g. :duration :recurring without
       an explicit :location :on-site) -- falls back to
       :one-off-remote-or-cognitive (cloud-itonami-isic-8299), the
       conservative default: it is the only target that carries no
       employer-of-record liability, so defaulting to it is the safest
