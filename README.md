# kotoba-occupation

Occupation registry for kotoba-lang and itonami open businesses.

This repository maps ISCO-08-coded sole-proprietor occupations to the
technology capabilities they need in order to operate. `cloud-itonami-isco-*`
uses this to move from a published occupation blueprint to an executable
operating stack — the occupation-classification counterpart to
`kotoba-industry` (ISIC-coded businesses).

## Contract

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.occupation :as occupation])

(occupation/get-occupation "2221")
(occupation/required-technologies "6112")
(occupation/readiness "9312" #{:forms :telemetry :audit-ledger :bpmn :dmn})
```

## Layers

- business: customer-facing open occupation blueprint
- occupation: ISCO-08-coded operating domain (what the worker does)
- technology: reusable kotoba-lang capability stack
- implementation: concrete repos, services and operators

ISIC classifies what a *business* produces; ISCO classifies what a *worker*
does. `cloud-itonami-{ISIC}` publishes industry-vertical business blueprints;
`cloud-itonami-isco-{code}` publishes sole-proprietor occupation blueprints
(1 occupation = 1 independent operator). The `isco-` infix in the repo name is
required — ISIC and ISCO-08 unit-group codes overlap numerically, so a bare
`cloud-itonami-{code}` would be ambiguous between the two registries.

7-9 representative unit groups per non-armed-forces ISCO-08 major group
(88/88 across major groups 1-9, up from the original 84/84 representative
sample as occupations are added alongside promotions; major group 0
"Armed Forces Occupations" is registry-only — a sole-proprietor OSS
business blueprint doesn't fit an armed-forces occupation, mirroring how
`kotoba-industry` also leaves some sections registry-only). 6112, 2221,
7126, 4321, 9312, 5322, 8332, 1321, 3253, 6210, 5223, 7231, 8121, 9111,
2512, 1120, 4110, 3213, 5153, 7411, 2262, 4222, 5311, 6130, 8160, 2166,
2641, 2651, 2652, 2654, 1219, 1223, 1330, 1341, 1349 and 1412 are
`:maturity :implemented` (real reference actors exist); the other 52 are
`:maturity :blueprint`. The remaining 348 ISCO-08 unit groups are
registered at `:maturity :spec` (registry-only stub, full
ISCO-08 coverage) for future promotion.

Note: per the "Future promotions will follow the langgraph.graph pattern
going forward" direction, 13 of the 36 `:implemented` entries — 6130,
8160, 2166, 2641, 2651, 2652, 2654, 1219, 1223, 1330, 1341, 1349 and 1412 — are on the full itonami Actor
pattern (a real `langgraph.graph/state-graph` with Advisor/Governor as
distinct nodes and human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume, per CLAUDE.md's
Actors section); the remaining 23 use the lighter standalone `Store` +
pure `governor/assess` function pattern from before that direction was
adopted.
